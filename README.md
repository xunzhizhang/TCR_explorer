TCR explorer

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Github repository contains the source codes and related information
of our app “TCR explorer”. This app can calculate the distances among
TCR sequences and visualize them by plotting their coordinates. Clusters
of corresponding antigens will also be divided and shown in different
colors.

To apply this app, please download all the files in this repository and
keep them in the same relative path. Library “shiny”, “ggplot2”,
“markdown” and “Rcpp” are required for the program.

When the app is run, three options are provided for data input. “Demo
data” provides an example for entire analyzed results; “Visualize your
data” is used to convert your entire data into plots; “Analyze your
data” is used to analyze raw TCR sequences. The format of entire data
should be the same as that of downloadable results, while an example of
raw sequences is provided by “Example sequences”. Different methods for
coordinate calculation could also been selected.
