##### **Tips**

This app analyzes the distances among TCR sequences and devided them
into clusters of antigens. The results are visualized with scatter
plots.

Three options are provided in the select box. “Demo data” provides an
example for entire analyzed results; “Visualize your data” is used to
convert your entire data into plots; “Analyze your data” is used to
analyze raw TCR sequences. The format of entire data should be the same
as that of downloadable results, while an example of raw sequences is
provided by “Example sequences”.
